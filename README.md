- **Ticket Verification**: Verify ticket validity using the ticket ID.

## Import necessary libraries
- **Streamlit**: For building the web app
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Regular Expressions (re)**: For pattern matching and string manipulation
- **Geopy**: For geocoding (converting addresses into geographic coordinates) and calculating distances between points
- **Folium**: For creating interactive maps
- **Streamlit-Folium**: For embedding Folium maps in Streamlit
- **Selenium**: For web browser automation
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Python Image Library to deal with images
- **MySQL Connector**: For connecting to MySQL databases
- **JSON**: For parsing and manipulating JSON data
- **Streamlit Lottie**: For embedding Lottie animations in Streamlit

## Conclusion
This application serves as a reference implementation of a UTS application, inspired by the Unified Ticketing System launched in Chennai. It demonstrates how such a system can provide a convenient and efficient ticketing experience for commuters.
